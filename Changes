Revision history for Perl extension Whim

{{$NEXT}}

    - Whim now uses its own user agent string, rather than the LWP
    default. This should make it less susceptible to having its requests
    refused by CDNs and similar services.

    - `whim send` now prints whether or not every target got a
    webmention sent to it, when given only a source URL as input. Thanks
    to timo for the patch (which I modified a bit for personal
    aesthetics).

    - The cpanfile now specifies a requirement of Mojo v8.25 or higher,
    guaranteeing that that `curfile` function of Mojo::File exists.
    Thanks to Slaven ReziÄ‡ for the bug report and suggestion.

    - Adding LWP::Protocol::https as a dependency. Thanks to Poorchop
    for the patch.

    - Updating documentation to point at Libera Chat instead of
    Freenode.

1.2020.09.23.0 2020-09-23T20:31:51Z

    - The default summary template now uses emoji instead of tiny inline
    images.

    - Fixing various bugs with the "query" subcommand. Thanks to
    timotimo on Freenode for pointing out these problems.

1.2020.07.19.1 2020-07-19T15:46:13Z

    - `whim send` now keeps you appraised of its activity and progress
    when run in single-argument mode.

    - Removing the ill-considered and untested `--entry` option for
    `whim send` and replacing with with a not-untested and
    less-ill-considered `--content` one.

1.2020.07.19.0 2020-07-19T14:07:01Z

    - The one-argument form of the `whim send` command will now attempt
    to send webmentions at every valid target on the source document, no
    longer limiting itself to those found within certain microformats. A
    new command-line option allows you to instead limit it to targets
    within the first h-entry microformat.

1.2020.07.12.0 2020-07-12T17:40:10Z

    - Stored webmentions now set themselves as requiring a re-check,
    possibly for updated (or deleted) content, on receipt of an
    identical copy.

    - Adding a `/summarize_wms` endpoint, with an associated template
    and new images.

1.2020.06.22.0 2020-06-22T18:37:27Z

    - original version
